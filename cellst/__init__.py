TODO: One of two things has to be True. Either _types has to
not contain the _types that users will actually use (think Condition, Experiment).
OR the non_user facing items in _types must be changed to private.

I don't want to go too crazy, but I do think some restructuring and consolidating
of utils is warranted. Hopefully I can get around to that tonight.
